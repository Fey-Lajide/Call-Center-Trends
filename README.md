# Call-Center-Trends
A PwC internship project that involved analyzing data for a call center to identify and visually show certain metrics and KPIs such as Average speed of answer, total number of calls, average length of calls, abandoned calls, and more.

<H2> DATA PREPARATION </H2>
<H3> DATA CLEANING </H3>
The following cleaning process was undergone to make the data suitable for modeling and analysis(DONE IN THE POWER QUERY ENVIRONMENT):<br/><BR/>

üëØ It was noticed that the table had no headers and that the first role were the headers for the table, and so the first row was promoted using the "use first row as header" prompt. <br/><BR/>
üëØ The datatype for the call id column was changed from numeric to text.<br/><BR/>
üëØ A conditional column was added for the column: satisfaction rating to properly convert the rating number to ratings that are easier to analyse and visualize.<BR/><BR/>
----- 5 - Very Satisfied<BR/>
----- 4 - Satisfied <BR/>
----- 3 - Neutral<BR/>
----- 2 - Unsatisfied<BR/>
----- 1 - Very unsatisfied

<H3> DATA TRANSFORMATION </H3>
The following measures were created using the DAX Functions. <br/><br/>
----- Agent Perfomance Quadrant = SUM(Sheet1[AvgTalkDuration])/[Total No of Answered Calls]<br/>
----- avg length of calls = [Length of Calls]/[Total No of Calls]<br/>
----- Avg Speed of Answer = SUM(Sheet1[Speed of answer in seconds])/[Total No of Answered Calls]<br/>
----- Length of Calls = SUM(Sheet1[Speed of answer in seconds])*SUM(Sheet1[AvgTalkDuration])<br/>
----- resolved cases = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id]), Sheet1[Resolved] = "Y")<br/>
----- Total Cases = COUNT(Sheet1[Resolved])<br/>
----- Total Neutral = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Satisfaction rating]), Sheet1[Satisfaction Level] = "Neutral")<br/>
----- Total No of Abandoned Calls = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Answered (Y/N)]), Sheet1[Answered (Y/N)] = "N")<br/>
----- Total No of Answered Calls = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Answered (Y/N)]), Sheet1[Answered (Y/N)] = "Y")<br/>
----- Total Satisfied = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Satisfaction rating]), Sheet1[Satisfaction Level] = "Satisfied")<br/>
----- Total Unatisfied = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Satisfaction rating]), Sheet1[Satisfaction Level] = "Unsatisfied")<br/>
----- Total Very Satisfied = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Satisfaction rating]), Sheet1[Satisfaction Level] = "Very Satisfied")<br/>
----- Total Very UnSatisfied = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Satisfaction rating]), Sheet1[Satisfaction Level] = "Very Unsatisfied")<br/>
----- unresolved cases = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sheet1[Call Id]), Sheet1[Resolved] = "N")<br/><br/>

<h2> DATA MODELLING </h2>
There was no need for modeling, as only one table was supplied.
<br/><br/>

</p>

<h2> DATA VISULAIZATION </h2>
The following visualization tools were used for their respective purposes:
<br><BR/>
üõ†Ô∏è Cards: To visualize the average speed of answer, answered calls, abandoned calls, and average length of calls <BR/><BR/>
üõ†Ô∏è Donut Chart: To visulize the overall customer satisfaction <BR/><BR/>
üõ†Ô∏è Line Chart: To visualize calls per time. </BR><BR/>
üõ†Ô∏è Slicer: For filtering agent and topic. </BR><BR/>
üõ†Ô∏è 100% Stacked Bar Chart: To visualize resolved vs unresolved cases. <BR/><BR/>
üõ†Ô∏è Scatter Plot: To show the agent quadrant (average call duration vs calls answered)
